Nebulae

Fusion is life, then gravity wins, radiant energy
A sliver of the spectrum, a scintillating reflection, eventually 

Coming from distances as far as we can measure
An unanticipated phenomenon destined for pleasure

Where deviation can only come from what may not even be a force
Steady is the course, shifts of blue and red, power gain and loss

Obsessed only on (an) odyssey outdating origin (an) original
A particular particle’s perpetual pilgrimage’s pinnacle
