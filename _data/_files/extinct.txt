RIP US

Extinct the first thought that I think 
The human race disappears in a blink
From Pu-239 fallout, death after flash and thunder
Or would it be hydrogen like the Tsar Bomba

The mushroom cloud penetrating the stratosphere 
Where we are well aware because telescopes stare 
Into the the heavens so we don’t miss
A killer rock from space like the one called Apophis

Just one of many possible celestial extinction events 
Then there is COVID-19 do pandemics make sinners repent
An opportunity for those who hate to expedite the date
As they tempt other peoples fate ignoring their golden gate

Tiny bad things invisible to the naked eye
Let your imagination wonder why and now there is AI
HAL’s story is a trip through what can be deadly
A space odyssey who is last on the Discovery 

We live on a marble in a vast cosmos you must trust
The universe and indeed the earth is trying to kill us
Earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, wildfires or pyroclastic flows
Climate change, drought then the famine follows as we die slow

By the way the sun will grow the world burns as it turns 
It’s hurts that life is worth less than money earned
But you think nothing could be worst that the infanticide
We humans are capable of genocide
