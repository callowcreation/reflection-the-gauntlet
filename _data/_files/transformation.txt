Then It Begins

WHO said, the world can be stopped?
Human transmission began to slow the clock

January: Start from the top, no it’s the first I mean, it’s scary
Country number one now under quarantine, this tiny adversary

February: Restrictions, public health, it’s an emergency
Now death’s exceeding a previous crisis’s quantity

March: WHO declares, the global prepares, a second wave an arch
Shut downs, stay at home orders and CARES start the march

April: "What do you have to lose?" take the Cocktail 
Reopening the economy, in hindsight, epic fail

May: Underestimated terrible toll but At home tests are on the way
A vaccine deal should help the Ordinal death count decay

June: Studies canceled WHO will make the decision soon?
Big business races, rise in cases, give the Task Force room

July: Record daily cases, WHO announces why?
Now airborne, cover faces, low HEALS make us cry

August: An increase in mortality risk thus, now masks are a must
In benefits we don’t trust, plus, reinfection reported, this thing’s robust 

September: A Global effort from WHO was rejected, do you remember?
Phase 3 Trials on the horizon after halts, no surrender

October: More spikes, cases top 40 million, however
Progress plays and pauses a flickering ember

November: 100,000 cases a day sadly we are the offenders
Nationwide immunity would be our only defender

December: Authorizations for vaccinations soon for all a planetary member 
But doses and distribution fall just short of splendor

2020 is done and gone, we didn’t win
It’s 2021, now let the transformation begin
