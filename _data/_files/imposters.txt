Imposter Syndrome

On the way from caterpillar to butterfly 
Does their experience ever keep them from taking to the sky

The majesty of the grand canyon is not evident as the headwaters part
The canvas’ beauty is not apparent when we start our art

The rings of a tree are complex, deliberate and unique
Like your history could be a mystery but they do not critique

Trapped and lacking the steam to reach high, potentially 
But the geysers of our world would utterly disagree

Your creation deserves not just a glance, we are in a trance
Be proud as the peacock’s strut and a bird of paradise’s dance
