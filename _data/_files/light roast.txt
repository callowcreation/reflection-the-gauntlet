“Clears throat…” Now get out a drink, I’d like to make a toast
Please hold up a beverage with proof, and I’ll start this roast
Let’s ask first, how’d you get that chest hair man?
When you sip on watered down drinks from a can

Just an observation which may help explain the floot skills
What’s worst is we are in the stream the room that it fills
Face stank indeed drinking and not smoking da ’erb
Will it make you slow like cheeky F New Zealand internet, toss that to the curb 

The internet may be like you an !hch, try that command in chat
Then ask where the star of the show Tony is at
I suspected jealousy but that command may be right on
Tony is not lost to be found but on loan to the pawn

Insulted, nice, nice, nice, oh are we
No TV, have a starter pack Virgin Hippy!
