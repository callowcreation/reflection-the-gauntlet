An Old Saying

The ocean color is blue to most eyes
To the wise a reflection of the beautiful skies

Trees are just trees, they can’t bend at the knees
Do they utter requests, does it end with a please

Dogs carrying fleas are said to be dirty
Ticks get thirsty too, to eat are they not worthy

Riddle me this why do we feel sick when it’s he/she that we miss
A symptom of being lonely that can be healed with a kiss

These things are all hidden from sight
Who really won the battle at the end of the fight

None of these are a mystery 
Knowledge is passed down through history 

An old saying if I’m inclined
All understanding comes from behind
