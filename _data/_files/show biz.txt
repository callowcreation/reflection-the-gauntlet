Adored Always

Love of my life 
My knight your armor it shines so bright
From your wife I’m saying thank you 
For slaying dragons like you do

You’re a virtuous lover by the way thanks for dinner
First in line to help the kids, I always knew you’re a winner
This glow on my face you are where it began
Your chiseled chest oh I can’t keep calm 

I know you love me everyday
And everything will be ok
But when you gonna honnor what you say 
And make me melt away 

Love of my life 
Hey there my knight your armor shines so bright
From your wife I’m saying thank you 
For slaying dragons like you do

Hey, Love of my life 
There’s my knight in armor shining so bright
From your wife I’m saying thank you 
For loving me like you do
