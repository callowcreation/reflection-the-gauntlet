Co-Craft

Alas you see I have company, here is now for you and me
I pass the baton to Nanagerie though not permanently
A tournament it be to make emotes I think he need a Hug
Over this past year I notice there should also be a Smug

A Nerd in here, there is an idea Give another that is a might
How about a Clap for when the music is just right
Or TriHard for the showoff or a Sweat Thisisfine
He doesn’t sip but we could Cheers and tip a glass of wine

What he does is spread Hype and put doubts to bed
The Stanky funky strings that he can Shred
On the case and may not finish she arts at a frantic pace
Is a tournament a race bring your best just in case
