Just Another Clock

Told on a surface where the meaning goes around
Helps keep pace, for wonder, and taste profound

Well written on faces told by the ages
Growth in stages and the turning of pages

Calms down rages a hypnotizing pendulum 
Dialed by the stars for a millennium 

Analog gears turn to digital over the years
Now atomic not the radiation scares

I personally pored hours into a glass
Imagining the future reminiscing on the past 

Stops on the horizon where our story ends
Lost in the meaning of the moment when we pretend
