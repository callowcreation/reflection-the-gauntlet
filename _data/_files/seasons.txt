Fleeting Flora

...As dry earth scape’s harsh light, radiate heat
Long days dark nights, natures defeat

From my perspective they fall yearly, why
Bare branches, seems like things just die

For some it’s nice, weather the storm 
The cold and ice, cozy and warm

Babies and bird sounds, light island breeze
Imagination deep in the fluffy clouds, relaxed at ease

Butterflies and bees prepare food and green trees
Sweet honey and fruit our needs indeed

Colors slowly drain away with the rains, no retreat 
Only gloom remains, but now repeat...
