Reiteration

Plain as the eye can see I can see my past
That’s my beautiful bride It’s our wedding day at last
Surrounded by joyous family and friends
I wish this wonderful day would never come to an end

The sun made her face glow in the video that day and it’s me
By her side she’s gorgeous as everyone can see
Cheered on by our acquaintances and kin 
Life ends if this day didn’t begin

Progressing into an union as I watch and not assuming
She was stunning that day and all consuming
Happy faces on the ladies and gents and relatives relatively
Nothing less than memorable honestly

It’s my reflection from an historic event
At my side simply gorgeous and heaven sent
Both our mothers are here, acquaintances and companions
Each year we can celebrate a marriage reunion

I’m reminiscing on a former hour a tuxedo and bridal gown
Ravishing and lovely she is guaranteed to right any frown
Enveloped by affection guys and gals and the clan
Feels unbelievable completing this nuptial plan

Past tense a reference to reverence
Intense dazzling is her radiance
Loved Ones who attend our preference or not
Groundhog is this day tie the knot was the plot
