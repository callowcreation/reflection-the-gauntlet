Cosmic Culture Appreciation Week

Quick trip a long time away
Light would take years to the day
An excited couple separately tells a story
About a pale blue rock, of holiday from Alpha Centauri
Oh it took just a moment to travel
With technology that makes the universe unravel

An experience today just a fantasy
Our visit to the The Pyramid of Giza during 4th dynasty

Another stop the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
What hung baked the party at the grand palace all night long

From there on the road to Rhoads
Where a Colossus rose to warn other foes

The Lighthouse of Alexandria a beacon Asking Alexandria
Near no Dear Insanity, now crumbled dreams at the bottom of the harbor

Another wonder, we saw, built for the goddess daughter of thunder
Worshiped at the Temple of Artemis for the innocent, a protector 

There sitting in grand splendor next on our agender
Through 5th century AD the Statue of Zeus at Olympia

Ending the trip the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus we arrived
But It seemed a bit late for construction, the tomb was occupied  

Not an ad for CCAW but we had fun so it can be
