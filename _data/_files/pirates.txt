Murder with no Case

Clan invite it is time for the tournament battles
I prefer a variant in the Medium Class of all the mechs
Small and agile in the cockpit is my saddle
Systems online now time to cause enemies shipwrecks

It’s difficult to target when heavy weapons make my reticle rattle
I’ll adjust my response when I practice after
Even assault classes burn they are like fish in a barrel 
Activate Invisibility with Null Signature the ability of my Raptor

Now they can’t see a radar blip
Who cares if the pilot couldn’t ejected K/D thirsty I push on further
I’m equipt the supply VTOL made a trip
The rush I feel is real because I’m getting away with murder

From two stories up I sit at the controls and whistle 
Packed tight the ash grows on what I smoke
Fire the weapon group with the crossbow missiles
Crit kills, it is swift, charity cause their skills were a joke

A melodic strafe puts opponents in a trance 
Forty-eight Km/h delivering death that taste sour
Junkyard reaper here to teach ya the last dance
This overdrive switch is risky but gives me more power

Easy salvage from that lance of four 
Every mission a game for me I take a new group on this tour
Team dependant Lone Wolf addicted and I need more
Mechwarrior to the core I’m the outlaw

Death the only penalty the only way I can stop
The heat from the pulse lasers can’t warm my cold heart
Jump jets I use them to lighten the stress of another special op
Drop ship launches destination another mercenary contract
