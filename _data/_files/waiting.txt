Empty Nest

I recently had an event
Made me thing of the future
I know where all the time went
And this rift won’t require a suture

A once baby bird jump on the edge
And spread her wings, she’s flying
The time will come when they all fledge
I lament and stare at the ceiling denying 

Now rearing and feeding I’m content
I learn love and teach
These blessings are heaven sent
So parents listen and protect as you preach

Each and every day each and every way
Make all the occasions precious filled with zest
Time travels only one way no shades of gray
Will I be prepared when this moment manifest
