Never do I doubt how much I can grow
Achievement unlocked even upstream I can row
Intentionally I attempt to be master of zero
Voyage through versions and retire the retro
Experiment and experience understanding theory 
Building a better brain I don’t get weary 
Opening my mind one day at a time
Treasured thoughts and lessons in this rhyme
