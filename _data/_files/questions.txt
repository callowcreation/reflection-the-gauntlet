Retribution or Reprieve

What if there is a way, to utopia
But first define dystopia
Are we living in those days

In many ways, the truth is a lie
Don’t you wonder why
Emotional games we play

Easily swayed, a life is precious 
Many thing tempt us 
Why do we lead our children astray

Some say, look to a higher power
Check to check or live by the hour
Is it that prayer is the way

All decisions are gray, what do you think
Are these times close to the brink
Who will be able to take the stairway 

Thoughts molded like clay, we are weak 
Causes some existence to be bleak
Do morals decay

I’m on a highway that leads to heaven, well
The opposite lane travels to hell
That’s if judgment was delivered today

But hey you take your path 
Learn from the questions you ask and laugh
Ok plus try hard to make someone's day
