All Order

Are you hungry
Let’s request some grub
For pizza we are the junkie
That’s what we all love

There would be six in this delivery
When we instruct the clerk
One for every head should fill our belly
It’s necessary for this to work

I’d command them to be quick
But we all know the drill
Be patient don’t panic
And we all split the bill

The arrangement of toppings 
Is repeated each time
Pineapple encourages mockings
So red onions and jalapeno on mine
