The King

By the date
It’s going to be long so please wait
Here’s the first 20 but no less that 77 he wrote
Stephen or Richard in my opinion is the GOAT

Carrie not the first but the start
Published before Salem’s Lot
Then The Shining sets horror apart

Psychological thriller Rage 
Next Night Shift let’s turn another page
Take The Stand it is post-apocalyptic
Now The Long Walk don’t be a skeptic

We are at The Dead Zone
There is also a Firestarter so don’t go alone
Slow down for Road Work ahead
Danse Macabre with “What’s Scary” time to dread

Cujo should be feared a rabid dog I’m a fan
You should now be The Running Man
Head to The Dark Tower be The Gunslinger
I know that this Creepshow is a winner

All in Different Seasons
And possessed Christine is the reason
Buried with beasts a Pet Sematary
Followed by Cycle of the Werewolf complimentary
Last It’s The Talisman how we end this fantasy
