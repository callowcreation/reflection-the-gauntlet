She Comes First!

All of sudden this village is to small for me
Deep pockets, my mind I haven’t lost it, time to prowl free

A sexy hot thing her eyes on bling, I can pay to stay
She can stay to play we can lay all day

Sex drugs and waist away...

No way, in this village I am a king and there is loyalty
We rule the kingdom, she is my queen we are royalty

But wait stop that press, love is a test
Life full of stress until we undress

It’s our fashion 
everyday pain every night passion

We know this right, that’s why we fight 
And so we can make up at night

So stray no way I honor what I say ok
I’m here to stay and make you melt away
