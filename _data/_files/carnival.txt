Still No Where

Physically not just in song
But we are strong
My hair was long 
A couple turmoil 
Revealed fantasy spoiled

Carry the strain 
Shoulder the pain
Why maintain 
Kidos growth is my aim

This is the carnival I live in

By force 
She removed it of course

It's not real
Yes the scissors made of steal
