The Polaroid

That’s a photo in a photo my babies PiP so I remember
The tiniest of them all is in a baby incubator
Some months before the doctor was suggesting
We abort because of a the Chorionic Villus Sampling
A shocking thought, disgusted we left we would avoid this grief
This physician it seems was a practicing life thief
So this image is so precious these days
I’m a papa full of pride in so many ways
As time passes I’ll reminisce on what I’ve seen and heard 
But I’ll be forced to hark back to the doc’s words
