Woof Woof

While hours pass by with patient delight 
Our steadfast companion day and night
Only huge hugs, makes all feel the tenderness
Frantic kisses for the mister and misses

We’ll play a game that requires the two of us
Obligated to you, make the rules I trust with no fuss 
One gift from pup to pal till when comes the end 
Forever man’s best friend, your best friend
