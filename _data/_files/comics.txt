Not Tony Stark?

His age at this stage twelve 
Let’s turn the page, well
BLASTER he did sell

Kinda lucky if you ask me
If your name is Tony
At twenty one inherited a billion dollar company

Now he’s twice as old
Drops out of a PHD program to pursue Zip2 it’s told
Earning $22 million at 7% when the company was sold

Captivity lit the first spark
It was then he build the original Mark
An ez win for Mr. Stark

Eight years pass 
Time to ditch gas
The Tesla Roadster goes space fast

Sponsor of the financial type
Joining The Avengers plight
Part of Good’s fight

Almost a decade goes by
SpaceX Dragon leaves the sky
Last I heard he wants to make cars fly

He reveals his identity 
Now protecting our country
Iron Man US Defense Secretary
