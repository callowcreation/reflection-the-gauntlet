Void Description

Just use the definition, a copout,  this seems absurd
But starting as a verb, here we go, may not be word for word

Discharge or drain away, excrete waste matter, a gross finding
Declare that last statement something not valid or legally binding

Now the noun may bring a frown so hold on to something or just sit down
A suit which in bridge and whist, your life, no cards dealt, facedown

Completely deserted space maybe in your heart,
unfilled cavity in a wall, structure or building
An emptiness caused by the loss of something, or being apart,
especially when your unwilling

The last qualifier is a modifier an adjective used to change the meaning
Of the preceding speech or action, that ineffectual and useless feeling

As a position that is vacant in an empty office
Free from or lacking form the hidden abyss
