Livin da Dream

I have a story to tell a quick rise extreme
And a hard crash but now things are looking up it seems
It is 2005 on the factory floor physical work for sure
Two years later a management position I did secure
Borderline poverty but a happy and feed family
The grind was mine daily, monthly, yearly

A tiny little thing was born during 2008 was the date 
Another new mouth needing food on his plate
But wait, my BlackBerry is ringing and on the line
Is an old production manager of mine
Are you happy, he asked, about your take home pay
He offered to triple my current earnings that very day

The discussion with my wife about changing jobs was quite brief
When I asked, I got an amazing offer, do you think I should leave
Now 2012 we were there, so near knocking on middle class door
That feeling you get when you can buy anything at the grocery store
Long days short nights heavy workload all the stress
Bringing work home my family helped me mend this mess

I quit 
I jumped in the Caddy and lit the green cig for the trip
I’m on the way to self-employment I can do it
Then I reassured my thought with the next hit
To advertise my skills I coded on stream
And picked up a few clients but still not the dream

In 2019 I was paid to build a Twitch chat bot
I hacked away everyday for a month non stop
Converting to JavaScript the Python source
Backend dev of course ever seen my fullstack horse
Long story short that was when it all began now my spirit is airborne
2021 I work from home helping build the crypto currency Bitcorn
