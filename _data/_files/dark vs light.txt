Lighter than Dark
+--------------------------------------------------------
+Darkness vs Right

Darkness where is the light
Darkness you're blinding my sight
Darkness I can't see wrong from right
Good vs evil the eternal fight

Darkness won't you take flight
Darkness leave my heart tonight
In my head, the thoughts they bite
At my conscious the endless plight

Darkness you hold on so tight
Ignite fires of sinful delight
Give in to the darkness, I just might
Forever to burn in the flames that I light

+--------------------------------------------------------
+Lighter than Dark

Goodness gracious me oh my
Goodness after or just another a lie
Goodness involved, a comforting a cry
Lucid thoughts from the otherside

Goodness from the Genesis, hearts did die
Goodness born again and live, another try
Forgiveness forever gives as one wonders why
Presence, past irrelevant, future drive

Goodness knows healing grows, but I oversimplify
The story goes no one knows, sacrifice (is) a supply
Does goodness ever give, we each must justify
Lighter than, darker than, where do you lie
