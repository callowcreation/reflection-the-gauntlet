Yum strawberry ice cream with sprinkles is the tapestry 
For the best swirl lollipop on the planet Disneyland is where I’ll be
You see ring candy is for kids and I’m a big boy craving cherry
Breathe cool with starlight mints plus breath freshener quite merry
This gauntlet week 35 craze represents 245 days
On its own we make this sweeter than candy in many ways
Jellybeans it seems the color hints the taste until BeanBoozled
They aren’t just for making beats they are also eats don’t be fooled
I did create something inspired by the sweets without rot for the teeth
The only things sweeter than Opolani yes that’s a knife not for grief 
But it’s to cut gumdrops to share and savor the slices of life
Sweet and tart Nerds also make music and a great husband or wife
Some random orange swirl candy probably from an mixed bag
Then the assorted chocolates a roulette game what kind did you snag
