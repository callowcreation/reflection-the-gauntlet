Memory Lane

A Song writer unexpected details with trombones entertain,
Then water disappears as if flowing down a drain.
Travelers even where the bosons don’t roam in vain,
Elemental orbs dirt, flame, air, and rain.

Sweet storms are brewing a musical hurricane in the queue,
As my heart is on fire so beautiful is this rocky lake view.
Quenched by a babies shower that replaces the flames too,
Also the sun high over waves that bring morning dew

Invisible forces move across the earth and shapes everything,
Like geometric pastels bringing energy and so inspiring.
Fantasy can be fiery for the sunset she’s waiting,
Glowing glass, a protection no fire and ice will be destroying.

A title called “Waveforms” perhaps where the silhouette is cast
Or reminisce on rock and rain’s scent form the past
Now can picture those combined, the romp is a blast
Potentially next the lawman will Rod the outlaw in contrast

Spontaneous and dynamic the flow of the fluid,
Wings of the butterfly nature represented
Earth, wind and fire or is that heart from cupid.
And the fever from the flames invented

Rendered in lego for this fifth elements trip
Your Multipass on this Memory Lane’s ship
