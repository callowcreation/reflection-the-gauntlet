Slumber Blunder

Darkness will there be peace tonight
What seem like hours just REM, let’s pretend
Fantasy so right, why are these lights so bright

Has it been, is it when, maybe then
Small spaces, big places, heart races
Fight or flight foe or friend 

A scary face, food without taste 
Can I fall forever, never
Lonely living, running without the chase

Over aware a monsters glare
Intense fear disappear so near
I don’t know where, I’ve hidden there

Now getting baked am I awake
Surreal so real I can feel
To good to not be fake

But wait I’m in my head we’re in bed
Seems to be another dream
Oh dear a nightmare instead
