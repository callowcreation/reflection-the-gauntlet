T-Pain TV

Tele you’ve got our vision listening to that funk
Entertaining always waiting it would seem
Loving that junk in the trunk
Escaping behind the walls into a dream
Verified groovy bass a taste of stardom
Impressive skills chill with the aristocrat
Stupendous if I will pick a term at random
I’m cool with that
Oh and the man in the TV easy
None other than a very handsome personality
