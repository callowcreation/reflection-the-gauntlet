Like Ghosting

I’ll close my eyes for you indefinitely
Another ambition, ignorant intention or fantasy

Alluring, I take the path of least resistance
Sleepwalking towards spooky action at a distance

That light not quite a fright in contrast an utter delight, 
I reach to grasp it tight to settle in orbit, your natural satellite 

Sudden realization, was I even close, not even almost
A long walk, led astray, will remain in limbo as a ghost
