My fear with a tear I know
The gauntlet will go the way of the dodo
A whole 30 days like the challenge
To long a time to manage
Wind out of the gauntlet sail
Boredom will be the final nail
There may be a way to rise
Are there any eyes looking forward to the prize
I think not
The short time is what makes this hot
Off the press these weeks has been a test
No less than the best
But I won’t stress
The journey has been blessed
