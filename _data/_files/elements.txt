Book of Water

A mystery, existing in these phases
Initially firm enough so we could turn the pages
A quick read unveils life through the ages
Now captured in cores so observe the stages

Zero that’s C to a hundred degrees
Electromagnetically always arranged in threes
Flows like time, up hill, a rewind would not be gravity
Falls of great beauty and walls in the seas

Given more energy and the power to part
Bonds stay the same as neighbors fly apart
Any smaller, oxygen and atoms from the start
To get even tinier strong nuclear forces at the heart
